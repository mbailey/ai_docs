# LiveKit Integration Implementation Notes

This document contains implementation notes and considerations for LiveKit integration with voice-mcp.

## Current Implementation Status

### What's Working
- Basic LiveKit connection when credentials are provided
- Room joining/leaving functionality
- Audio transport switching between local and LiveKit
- Automatic fallback from LiveKit to local microphone

### Configuration Flow
1. User sets LiveKit environment variables (URL, API_KEY, API_SECRET)
2. voice-mcp detects LiveKit configuration on startup
3. When `converse` is called with `transport="auto"` (default), tries LiveKit first
4. Falls back to local microphone if LiveKit unavailable

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Token Generation Challenge

**Current Issue**: Clients need API secret to generate tokens, which is insecure for frontend apps.

**Potential Solutions**:
- Add optional token generation endpoint to voice-mcp
- Integrate with Pipedream LiveKit MCP for token generation
- Document best practices for secure token generation

### 2. Room Management

**Current Behavior**: 
- Creates rooms on-demand
- No automatic cleanup
- No room listing capability

**Improvements Needed**:
- Add `list_rooms` tool
- Implement room cleanup after period of inactivity
- Add room status monitoring

### 3. Multi-Device Synchronization

**Use Case**: User wants to access same conversation from phone and desktop

**Requirements**:
- Persistent room names
- Participant identity management
- State synchronization between devices

## Frontend Integration Options

### 1. Voice Assistant Swift (iOS)
- TestFlight app available
- Requires LiveKit credentials
- Works well for personal use
- Limited customization options

### 2. Voice Assistant Frontend (Web)
- Open source React app
- Fully customizable
- Requires Node.js setup
- Good for development/testing

### 3. LiveKit Playground
- Instant access via LiveKit Cloud dashboard
- No setup required
- Limited to testing
- Good for quick demos

### 4. Custom Frontend
- Maximum flexibility
- Can integrate with existing apps
- Requires more development effort
- Best for production use

## Architecture Considerations

### Transport Abstraction

```python
# Current pattern in voice-mcp
if transport == "auto":
    try:
        # Try LiveKit first
        await livekit_transport.connect()
    except:
        # Fall back to local
        await local_transport.connect()
```

This pattern works well but could be enhanced with:
- Transport health checks
- Automatic reconnection
- Quality-based switching

### Audio Pipeline

```
User Speech → Microphone/LiveKit → STT → LLM → TTS → Speaker/LiveKit → User
```

Key considerations:
- Minimize latency at each step
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Optimize audio quality vs. bandwidth

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Connection Pooling
- Reuse LiveKit room connections
- Implement connection timeout
- Pre-warm connections for faster response

### 2. Audio Buffering
- Balance latency vs. reliability
- Implement adaptive buffering
- Handle packet loss gracefully

### 3. Concurrent Processing
- STT can start before speech ends
- TTS can start before LLM completes
- Overlap processing stages where possible

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Token Security
```python
# Good: Server-side token generation
def generate_token(room_name, participant_identity):
    return AccessToken(api_key, api_secret).with_grants(
        VideoGrants(room_join=True, room=room_name)
    ).with_identity(participant_identity).to_jwt()

# Bad: Exposing API secret to clients
NEVER: include api_secret in client configs
```

### 2. Room Access Control
- Implement room passwords or access codes
- Use participant metadata for authorization
- Set appropriate token expiry times

### 3. Data Privacy
- Audio streams are end-to-end encrypted
- No recording by default
- Implement consent mechanisms if recording

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Tests
- Mock LiveKit client for predictable testing
- Test fallback scenarios
- Verify error handling

### 2. Integration Tests
- Use LiveKit's test server
- Test real audio flows
- Verify multi-participant scenarios

### 3. Load Testing
- Test with multiple concurrent rooms
- Measure audio latency under load
- Verify resource cleanup

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Enable Debug Logging
```bash
export VOICE_MCP_DEBUG=true
export LIVEKIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### 2. Monitor Network Quality
- Check LiveKit dashboard for connection stats
- Monitor packet loss and jitter
- Use browser DevTools for WebRTC stats

### 3. Audio Troubleshooting
- Verify microphone permissions
- Check audio device selection
- Test with different audio formats

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Room Features
- Waiting rooms
- Host controls
- Recording capabilities
- Live transcription

### 2. Multi-Modal Support
- Screen sharing
- Video support
- File sharing
- Collaborative features

### 3. Analytics Integration
- Usage tracking
- Quality metrics
- Error reporting
- Performance monitoring

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Token Expiry
- Set reasonable expiry times (not too short)
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Handle expiry gracefully

### 2. Network Interruptions
- Implement exponential backoff for reconnection
- Cache state for resumption
- Notify user of connection issues

### 3. Audio Feedback
- Implement echo cancellation
- Use headphones for testing
- Monitor audio levels
